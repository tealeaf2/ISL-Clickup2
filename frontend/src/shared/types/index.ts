/**
 * Type Definitions Index
 * 
 * Central export point for all type definitions used throughout the application.
 * 
 * This file re-exports types from:
 * - `clickup.ts`: Types matching ClickUp API responses
 * - `task.ts`: Internal task types for the dependency graph
 * 
 * Import types from this file for consistency:
 * ```typescript
 * import type { Task, ClickUpTask, TaskStatus } from '@/shared/types';
 * ```
 */

export * from './clickup';
export * from './task';
